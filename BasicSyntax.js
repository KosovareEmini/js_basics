/**
    The following content explains the basic syntax rules 
    that has to be followed in the JavaScript programming language.

    They are no-op rules, which means that we have to abide by them.
    Still, starting JavaScript is not that hard after all.
    So, here are some key points:

    1. Statements end with a semicolon (;).​​

    2. Code blocks are enclosed in curly braces ({ }).​​

    3. JavaScript is case-sensitive (e.g., myVariable is different from myvariable).​​

    4. Comments can be single-line (//) or multi-line (\/* *\/).​

/**
 * Variable Declaration Options
 * var   - try not to use them, they are leftover from the old versions of EcmaScript versions (pre 2015 - ES6).
 * let   - use them when you declare primitives and complex types that you expect to be reassigned at some point.
 * const - use them when you do not expect the value of the primitive or the complex type itself to be reassigned.
